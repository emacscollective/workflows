## GitHub Actions workflows for use in packages I maintain

These actions are tailored to how things are done in these packages.
Using them unmodified for your own packages likely won't work.

## Used third-party actions

- [actions/checkout@v4](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
- [aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)
- [purcell/setup-emacs@master](https://github.com/purcell/setup-emacs)

## Related resources

- [emacscollective/org-macros] contains macros used in my manuals.
- [emacscollective/workflow-experiments] together with `experiments.yml`
  in this repository are used to run experiments.
- [emacsmirror/.savannah] actions to mirror GNU Emacs and [Non]GNU Elpa.
- [magit/actions] the deprecated predecessor of these workflows, which uses
  actions instead.  Don't do thatâ€”you would have to add more boilerplate to
  your repositories, and what's worse, you would much more frequently end up
  having to update each copy.
